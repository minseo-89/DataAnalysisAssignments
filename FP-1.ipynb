    "\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\">The primary purpose of this project is to use student survey data to determine which academic, lifestyle, and environmental factors are the most significant predictors of mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety.</span>\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\">The key **dependent variables** (DVs) are the students' mental health scores: **Depression** (depression), **Anxiety** (anxiety), and **Isolation** (isolation). These are all measured on a Likert scale (1-5).</span>\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\">Key **independent variables** (IVs) include: **Academic Pressure** (academic_pressure), **Financial Concerns** (financial_concerns), **Social Relationships Score** (social_relationships), **Campus Discrimination** (campus_discrimination), and **Average Sleep** (average_sleep).</span>\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\">The dataset, provided as MentalHealthSurvey.csv, contains **87** cases (individual student responses) and includes **21** total variables (3 DVs and 18 IVs).</span>\n",
